## Installation

Use the [installation guide at Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/environment/environment.html) for instructions on installing Ruby.

## Running Tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ ruby bob_test.rb
```

Only the first test will be executed, all the others have been made pending
using the `skip` method. Delete the next `skip` as you get each test passing.
