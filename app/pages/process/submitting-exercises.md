After you've [fetched the exercises](/help/fetch) and written an implementation that gets the tests passing, then you're ready to submit the code to the website so you can discuss its merits and receive feedback.

```bash
$ exercism submit path/to/your/code.ext
```

For example, if you have been working on the `leap` exercise in Go, you might be in the same directory as the test suite and the code:

```bash
$ cd ~/exercism/go/leap
$ ls -1
leap.go
leap_test.go
README.md
```

Then you would submit the code with the following command:

```bash
$ exercism submit leap.go
```
